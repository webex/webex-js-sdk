/**
 * Interface for Call Settings Module.
 * This encompasses set of APIs that allows to retrieve and update the settings like CallWaiting, DND, CallForward, Voicemail and more.

 * These APIs return promises that resolve to a `CallSettingResponse` object, which contains a status code, data, and message.
 * The data field within this response object holds the `callSetting` object, which can take on different types depending on the specific API called.
 *
 * Example
 * ```json
 * {
 *  statusCode: 200,
 *    data: {
 *      callSetting: ToggleSetting | CallForwardSetting | VoicemailSetting | CallForwardAlwaysSetting
 *    },
 *  message: 'SUCCESS'| 'FAILURE' | null
