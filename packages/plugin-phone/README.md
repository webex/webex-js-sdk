# Call

**Extends SparkPlugin**

## localMediaStream

Returns the local MediaStream for the call. May initially be `null`
between the time @{Phone#dial is invoked and the  media stream is
acquired if [Phone#dial](#phonedial) is invoked without a `localMediaStream`
option.

This property can also be set mid-call in which case the streams sent to
the remote party are replaced by this stream. On success, the
[Call](#call)'s <localMediaStream:change> event fires, notifying any
listeners that we are now sending media from a new source.

## localMediaStreamUrl

Object URL that refers to [Call#localMediaStream](#calllocalmediastream). Will be
automatically deallocated when the call ends

## remoteMediaStream

Access to the remote partyâ€™s `MediaStream`. `null` before connected.

## remoteMediaStreamUrl

Object URL that refers to [Call#remoteMediaStream](#callremotemediastream). Will be
automatically deallocated when the call ends

    generated by the sdk will be uploaded to the Spark Cloud. Care has been taken
    to avoid including PII in these logs, but if you've taken advantage of the
    SDK's logger, you should make sure to avoid logging PII as well.
