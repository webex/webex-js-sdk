This is the list of environment variable used by this plugin:

- `WEBEX_CONVERSATION_DEFAULT_CLUSTER` - The name of the conversation cluster that contains all of the organizations and spaces prior to federation phase 2. This defaults to `urn:TEAM:us-east-2_a:identityLookup` for production but can be changed to `urn:TEAM:us-east-1_int13:identityLookup` for integration.
- `WEBEX_CONVERSATION_CLUSTER_SERVICE` - The name of the conversation cluster service used to lookup the host in the hostmap. Defaults to `identityLookup`, but if the service changes, will need to be updated.
