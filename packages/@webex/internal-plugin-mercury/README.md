## Using A Proxy Agent To Open A Websocket Connection

For consumers who are not using the SDK via the browser it may be necessary to configure a proxy agent in order to connect with Mercury and open a Websocket in a proxy environment.

This can be done by configuring an agent as part of a DefaultMercuryOptions config object as shown below. The agent object will then be injected into the SDK and used in the Mercury plugin during WebSocket construction as an option property, allowing a connection to be established via the specified proxy url.

```js
const webex = require(`webex`);
const HttpsProxyAgent = require('https-proxy-agent');

let httpsProxyAgent = new HttpsProxyAgent(url.parse(proxyUrl));

webex.init({
	config: {
	  defaultMercuryOptions: {
		agent: httpsProxyAgent
	  },
	 ...
	}
});
```
