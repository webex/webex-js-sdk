# Simultaneous Interpretation

Simultaneous Interpretation (SI) feature provides support for interpretation of in-meeting audio. The host will specify the target languages at schedule time and assign language pairs to the desired interpreters. Each interpreter will use their client to indicate the language spoken at any point in time. For example, Alice might be translating between English and French. When an English speaker is talking in the meeting, Alice will use her client to indicate she is speaking French. When a French speaker is talking, Alice will indicate that she is speaking English. The hostâ€™s client will display the status of each interpreter including the current interpretation direction.

### Structure
