## Install

```bash
npm install --save @webex/plugin-memberships
```

## Usage

This is a plugin for the Cisco Webex JS SDK. While most of the functionality of this plugin can be utilized using specific scopes, such as `spark:memberships_read` and `spark:memberships_write`, utilizing the `listen()` method of this plugin will require both `spark:all` and `spark:kms`. Please note that by toggling an application's `spark:all` scope via the portal will also toggle its `spark:kms` scope. Please see our [developer portal](https://developer.webex.com/) and the [API docs](https://webex.github.io/webex-js-sdk/api/) for full details.

## Install

```bash
npm install --save @webex/plugin-memberships
```

## Usage

```js

const Webex = require('webex');

const webex = Webex.init();
webex.memberships.get(id)
  .then((membership) => {
    console.log(membership);
  })

```
