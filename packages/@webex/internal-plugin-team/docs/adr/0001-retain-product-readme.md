# ADR-0001 - Retain the product README

| Field         | Value |
| ------------- | ----- |
| Status        | Accepted |
| Decision date | 2026-11-12 |
| Deciders      | rarajes2@cisco.com (bootstrap questionnaire) |
| Supersedes    | N/A |
| Superseded by | N/A |

## Context

Onboarding found one existing document, `README.md`. It is the npm page: a one-line description
("Plugin for the Team service"), an internal-plugin notice, an install command, and a Usage block. No
other intent, design, or AI-authored spec exists in this package.

The README documents no behavior that the code has:

| README content | Code |
| -------------- | ---- |
| Usage ends with the placeholder member `webex.internal.team.WHATEVER` | The plugin exposes `create`, `get`, `list`, `createConversation`, and eleven more methods (`src/team.js`) |
| No method, option, or result is described | Methods take team, conversation, and activity objects and resolve service bodies or posted activities (`src/team.js`) |
| Nothing about encryption | Importing the package registers transforms that encrypt and decrypt team names and summaries (`src/index.js`) |

## Decision

Keep `README.md` unchanged. Do not migrate it into the module specification. Record
`spec_source_policy.mode` as `keep-separate` with `migrated_source_disposition` `retain`, and route
`README.md` in `spec_sources` as `reference-only` and `context-only`.

The canonical behavior is `src/` plus `test/`. The module specification follows code.

## Why

The README is the npm-facing page. Filling it in is a product-doc change, not a requirement of making
the package SDD-ready, and the other onboarded packages in this workspace kept their READMEs the same
way. It holds no behavioral claim to preserve, so nothing is lost by not migrating it.

## Alternatives considered

| Alternative | Why it was not selected |
| ----------- | ----------------------- |
| Migrate the README into `src/docs/README.md` and delete it | It carries no behavior to migrate; deletion was not requested |
| Reconcile the README with the module specification in place | Reconciling would only preserve placeholder wording; the developer chose `keep-separate` |
| Rewrite the README during onboarding | Onboarding writes the SDD tree only and does not edit `README.md` |

## Consequences

**Positive:**

- The npm page stays stable for consumers.
- The module specification is the single behavioral reference.

**Negative / tradeoffs:**

- Agents must not treat `README.md` as a usage reference; its Usage block names a member that does not
  exist.
- The placeholder README remains until a maintainer makes a separate product-doc change.

## Constraint on future changes

Do not delete `README.md` as part of spec maintenance. If its usage text changes, keep the module
specification aligned with code rather than with the README.

## Follow-up

- [ ] A maintainer may replace the README Usage placeholder with real `create`, `list`, and team
  activity examples in a separate product-doc change.

## Revisit when

- A maintainer rewrites the README to document the team methods.

## References

- `README.md`
- `src/index.js`
- `src/config.js`
- `src/team.js`
- `.sdd/manifest.json` `spec_source_policy`
