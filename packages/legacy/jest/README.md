## Installation

Since this package is marked `private` as a part of its definition, it can only be consumed locally within this project.

This package is meant to be consumed as a **dev-dependency**, and requires the following peer-dependencies:

* `@babel/core`
* `jest`
* `@webex/babel-config-legacy`

Installation, local to this project, can be performed by using the following commands:

```bash
# Project root installation.
yarn add --dev @webex/jest-config-legacy @webex/babel-config-legacy @babel/core jest

# Package installation.
yarn workspace @{scope}/{package} add --dev @webex/jest-config-legacy @webex/babel-config-legacy @babel/core jest
```

## Usage

This package is expected to be used with [Jest](https://jestjs.io/).

A Jest configuration file must be consumed within the target package using the following configuration definition example:

```js
// ./jest.config.js
const config = require('@webex/jest-config-legacy');

const modified = {
  ...config,
  ...{ /* override configuration */ },
};

module.exports = modified;
```

This package is also dependent on our locally referencable `@webex/babel-config-legacy` package to provide the jest runner with the babel tooling needed to interpret source code when applicable.
