### Log Levels

This logger plugin supports different logging levels to control what gets output to the user's console:

- **silent**
  - Nothing prints to the console.
- **error** [DEFAULT]
  - Error messages thrown by exceptions. This level is meant for the developer and end user to help with troubleshooting.
  - Example: `Unable to connect to websocket on port 4343`
- **warn**
  - Warning messages meant to help guide developers away from potential errors.
  - Example: `The usage of person email has been deprecated`
- **log**
  - General output of logging messages.
  - Example: `Websocket connected on port 4343`
- **info**
  - More detailed logging of SDK information.
  - Example: `Network status changed from DISCONNECTED to ONLINE`
- **debug**
  - Developer specific information, helpful with debugging issues.
  - Example: `Network packet received, contents: {data}`
- **trace**
  - Prints the stack trace of the current call path.

### Level Control

The developer can control what level gets printed by setting the environment variable: `WEBEX_LOG_LEVEL`.

These variables can be set on the command line or in the `.env` file:

```bash
WEBEX_LOG_LEVEL="debug" npm start
```

```env
# .env file
WEBEX_LOG_LEVEL=debug
```
