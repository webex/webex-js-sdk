 * Use the ROAP protocol to handle signaling, messaging, and state.
 *
 * TODO: ROAP will be implemented similarly to the web client, sans Flux architecture.
 *
 * Current web client files:
 * - roapInterface - Accepts parameters whose values come from the meeting object (what has to be sent); return Promise with request body
 * - roapAdapter - Sends requests to server, i.e., makes API calls.
 * - roapHandler - A state manager; "This meeting is in this particular state."
