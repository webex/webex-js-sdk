# Meetings Plugin Usage Guide

The `plugin-phone` plugin is deprecated and replaced with `plugin-meetings`.
With this change comes significant code changes in upgrading to the meetings plugin.
The meetings plugin is much more feature rich and maintained than the phone plugin.

For users of the phone plugin, one of the main changes from `plugin-phone` is the idea of having a `meeting` object that we are performing actions on.
Instead of just "calling" a destination, a meeting object must be "created" and then "joined".

## Setup

### Is Calling Supported

The phone plugin provided a `isCallingSupported()` method to detect if WebRTC was supported in the user's browser.

This method is no longer provided and if the functionality is needed, we suggest you use the [DetectRTC Package on NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/detectrtc).

### Device Registration

Meeting data is received via websockets from the Webex Servers.
In order for the client to receive these websocket events, it must register with the websocket servers.

When using the phone plugin, this was handled automatically for you via `webex.phone.register()`.

With the meetings plugin, we provide the same method:

```js
webex.meetings.register()
```

## Dialing

Previously, users of the phone plugin could do a `webex.phone.dial(destination)` command.
Unfortunately, this "single line of code" method is not possible with the features that the meetings plugin provides.
Instead, a meeting object must be created, joined and media added.
This new method is much more deliberate and less "magical", allowing the developer to fully control all steps of the calling process.

## Meeting Creation

As stated above, before any actions can be performed on a meeting, the object must be created. This is done via:

```js
const myMeeting = await webex.meetings.create(destination);
```

## Joining a Meeting

Once a meeting object has been created, to start it, simply `join` it:

```js
await myMeeting.join();

// Now, Add Media
```

### Joining a one-on-one meeting

```js
let destination = "testuser@webex.bot";

const myMeeting = await webex.meetings.create(destination);

await myMeeting.join();

// Now, Add Media
```

### Joining a group meeting

```js
let conversationUrl = `https://conv-a.wbx2.com/conversation/api/v1/ObiwanAnnouncementsConversationUUID`;

const myMeeting = await webex.meetings.create(conversationUrl);

await myMeeting.join();

// Now, Add Media
```

## Meeting Media

After a meeting is created and joined, the media from the meeting needs to be connected.

### Local Media

To get the local device media we use the function on the meeting object `getMediaStreams`. This takes an options object of which media streams to enable:

```js
const mediaSettings = {
  receiveVideo: true,
  receiveAudio: true,
  receiveShare: true,
  sendVideo: true,
  sendAudio: true,
  sendShare: false
};

const mediaStreams = await meeting.getMediaStreams(mediaSettings);
const [localStream, localShare] = mediaStreams;
```

This local stream is now ready to be added to the DOM for a self preview via:

```html
<video id="localvideo" muted="true" autoplay playsinline></video>
```

```js
document.getElementById('localvideo').srcObject = localStream;
```

### Adding Media

Once you have your local streams and shares, you need to add the media to the meeting with the `addMedia` function.

```js
const mediaResponse = await meeting.addMedia({
  localShare,
  localStream,
  mediaSettings
});
```

## Meeting Events

Just like the phone plugin, the meeting object will emit events that the developer can listen to and act upon.

### `media:ready`

```js
myMeeting.on('media:ready', (media) => {
  // Handle media streams
})
```

This event is emitted when a media stream is ready to be rendered. It contains an object with two properties:

* `stream` the actual media stream that can be used in an html srcObject
* `type` the type of stream that is ready (`local`, `remoteVideo`, etc)

### `media:stopped`

```js
myMeeting.on('media:stopped', (media) => {
  // Remove media streams
})
```

This event is emitted when a stream has stopped sending. It has a `type` property to know which media to remove from the DOM.

## Media Control

### Stop Sending Audio/Video

With the call object from the phone plugin, you could:

```js
call.stopSendingVideo();
call.stopSendingAudio();
```

With a meeting object, you use these functions:

```js
meeting.muteAudio();
meeting.muteVideo();
```

### Start Sending Audio/Video

With the call object from the phone plugin, you could:

```js
call.startSendingVideo();
call.startSendingAudio();
```

With a meeting object, you use these functions:

```js
meeting.unmuteAudio();
meeting.unmuteVideo();
```

### Start Sending Share

With the call object from the phone plugin, you could:

```js
call.startScreenShare();
```

With a meeting object, you use these functions:

```js
// First get the local screen share stream
const mediaStreams = await meeting.getMediaStreams(mediaSettings);
const [localStream, localShare] = mediaStreams;
// Then, update share
meeting.updateShare({sendShare: true, receiveShare:true, stream: localShare})
```

### Stop Sending Share

With the call object from the phone plugin, you could:

```js
call.stopScreenShare();
```

With a meeting object, you use these functions:

```js
meeting.stopShare();
```

## Ending a Meeting

With the call object from the phone plugin, you could:

```js
call.hangup();
```

Now, to do the same, you have to leave the meeting:

```js
myMeeting.leave();
```

## Listing Active Calls

When looking for a user's currently active calls, with the phone plugin the developer would call `phone.listActiveCalls()` which resolved with an array of call objects.

With the meetings plugin, we want to sync our meetings collection with the server:

```js
// Sync Meetings From Server
await webex.meetings.syncMeetings();

// Existing meetings live in the meeting collection
const existingMeetings = webex.meetings.meetingCollection.meetings;
```

## Incoming Calls

With the meetings plugin, incoming calls are still emitted as an event.
Unlike the phone plugin though, there isn't a special event for an "incoming call", instead the event is emitted as a "meeting added" event.

### Listening for incoming calls

With the phone plugin, one would previous listen to incoming calls like this:

```js
sparkInstance.phone.on('call:incoming', (incomingCall) => {
  // Handle incoming call
  incomingCall.acknowledge();
});
```

When listening to an added meeting, to determine if it is an "incoming" meeting, check the type property of the meeting:

```js
webex.meetings.on('meeting:added', (addedMeeting) => {
  if (addedMeeting.type === 'INCOMING' || addedMeeting.type === 'JOIN') {
    // Handle incoming meeting
    addedMeeting.acknowledge();
  }
```

(Note: group spaces emit a `JOIN` when someone starts, where 1:1 spaces emit `INCOMING`)

### Answering incoming calls

The phone plugin had the concept of `answer`ing an incoming call.
This concept doesn't exist in the meetings plugin.
Instead, you simply `join` the meeting as described above.

Phone plugin:

```js
incomingCall.answer();
```

```js
addedMeeting.join();
```
