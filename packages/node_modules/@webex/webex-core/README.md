## Install

```bash
npm install --save @webex/webex-core
```

## Usage

### Client Scope Requirements

To utilize the basic functionality of the `services` plugin that is bound to the `webex-core` plugin upon initialization, the following scopes must be present in the provided client's scopes:

- `spark:all`

### Environment Variables

The following environment variables are used by this plugin:

- `U2C_SERVICE_URL` - stores the service catalog collecting url, typically the **U2C** service

### Configuration

The `services` plugin that is bound to the `webex-core` plugin upon initialization supports the ability to inject discovery urls via the constructor:

```js
const webex = new Webex({
  config: {
    services: {
      hydra: 'https://api.ciscospark.com/v1'
    }
  }
});
```

The default configuration includes the **U2C** url as defined by environment variable `U2C_SERVICE_URL` or the default `https://u2c.wbx2.com/u2c/api/v1`
