## Install

```bash
npm install --save @webex/webex-core
```

## Usage

### Client Scope Requirements

To utilize the basic functionality of the `services` plugin that is bound to the `webex-core` plugin upon initialization, the following scopes must be present in the provided client's scopes:

- `spark:all`

### Environment Variables

The following environment variables are used by this plugin:

- `HYDRA_SERVICE_URL` - Stores the public hydra api url for managing Webex Teams resources.
- `U2C_SERVICE_URL` - Stores the service catalog collecting url, typically the **U2C** service.

### Configuration

The `services` plugin that is bound to the `webex-core` plugin upon initialization supports the ability to inject discovery urls via the constructor:

```js
const webex = new Webex({
  config: {
    services: {
      // Services that are available before catalog retrieval.
      discovery: {
        hydra: 'https://api.ciscospark.com/v1'
      },

      // Validate domains against the allowed domains.
      validateDomains: true,

      // The allowed domains to validate domains against.
      allowedDomains: ['allowed-domain']
    }
  }
});
```

The default configuration includes the following service urls:

- `U2C_SERVICE_URL` [ **U2C** ] - `https://u2c.wbx2.com/u2c/api/v1`
- `HYDRA_SERVICE_URL` [ **Hydra** ] - `https://api.ciscospark.com/v1`
