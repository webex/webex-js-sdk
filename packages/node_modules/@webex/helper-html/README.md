## Install

```bash
npm install --save @webex/helper-html
```

## Usage

### `filter(allowedTags, allowedStyles, html)`

Filters an html string such that it only includes the allowed tags and styles. Disallowed tags and styles are removed while their contents are kept.

`allowedTags` is an object keyed on tag name mapped to an array of attribuets allowed for that tag.
`allwedStyles` is an array of allowed style string.
`html` is a string.

Returns a promise that resolves with the new html string.

### `filterSync()`

See `filter()`

### `filterEscape(processCallback, allowedTags, allowedStyles, html)`

Filters an html string such that it only includes the allowed tags and styles. Disallowed tags and styles and their children are escaped.

`processCallback` synchronous callback that receives the body of the html fragment generated from `html`. Presents an opportunity to do preprocessing (e.g turn urls into links) without parsing html `mulitple` times
`allowedTags` is an object keyed on tag name mapped to an array of attribuets allowed for that tag.
`allwedStyles` is an array of allowed style string.
`html` is a string.

Returns a promise that resolves with the new html string.
