          <h1>What's Happening: Read Status Sample</h1>

          <p>
            This sample illustrates how browser based custom clients can use the Webex Javascript SDK's
            functions and events to discover and update the read status for the spaces that a user is a member of.
            Specifically it illustrates the use of the following functions:
          </p>

          <div id=space-status>
              <style>
                table, th, td {
                  border: 1px solid black;
                  border-collapse: collapse;
                }
                th, td {
                  padding: 5px;
                }
              </style>
                  
              <center>
                <p></p>
            <table>
              <tr style="font-weight:bold">
                <td>Function</td>
                <td>Returns</td>
                <td>Purpose</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>rooms.listWithReadStatus()</td>
                <td>
                  A list of spaces that the user is a member of.<br>
                  Each space includes a lastSeenDate and a lastActivityDate
                </td>
                <td>
                  Determine which spaces have unread messages in them.<br>
                </td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>rooms.getWithReadStatus()</td>
                <td>
                  <br>
                  An object with the <em>lastSeenDate</em> and a <em>lastActivityDate</em> for a specific space.
                </td>
                <td>
                  Determine if a previously unknown space has unread messages in them.<br>
                </td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>memberships.listWithReadStatus()</td>
                <td>
                  <br>
                  A list of members in a space.<br>
                  Each member includes a <em>lastSeenID</em> and <em>lastSeenDate</em>.
                </td>
                <td>
                  Determine which members are "caught up" or "behind" in a space.<br>
                </td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>memberships.updateLastSeen()</td>
                <td>
                  <br>
                  An updated membership object.<br>
                  The <em>lastSeenId</em> will match the message object that was passed to it.
                </td>
                <td>
                  Update the <em>lastSeendId</em> and <em>lastSeenDate</em> for the custom client's user.<br>
                </td>
              </tr>
            </table>
          </center>  
          </div>
          <p></p>

          <p>
            After a valid token is provided and authorized, the application calls the
            <em>rooms.listWithReadStatus()</em> to get a list of spaces.  For users who are in many spaces
            this API can take a long time to return, so it is initially called by pasing it the 
            optional <em>maxRecent</em> parameter set to 30, in order to update the GUI quickly with 30 
            spaces with recent activity.  It calculates which spaces are have unread messages by comparing
            the <em>lastSeenDate</em> and the <em>lastActivity</em> date of each space.   While processing the first batch  
            it calls <em>rooms.listWithReadStatus()</em> again to get the complete list of rooms. Its worth noting
            that the maximum number or rooms returned will be 1000 so it is not guaranteed that 
            this function will return ALL the rooms, but clients can always call the 
            <em>rooms.getWithReadStatus(roomId)</em> function anytime they get an event for a previously
            unseen space.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once the application has built its cache of spaces the user is a member of, it
            registers to listen to the following events:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>messages:created</b> when this event arrives the application updates the 
              "Most recent messages:created event" table, and updates the <em>lastActivityDate</em>
              of the cached space info.  If the message was sent by someone other than the user it updates 
              the "Most Recent Title" in the "Behind" column and calls the 
              <em>memberships.listWithReadStatus()</em> function to update the "Other Member's Read Status"
              columns.  It also enabled the "Mark as Read" button.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>memberships:seen</b> when this event arrives the application updates
              the "Most recent memberships:seen (read receipt) event" table.  If the event was
              generated for our user, it might update the status of the space from "Behind" to
              "Caught Up".  If the event is for another member, and the space is currently displayed
              on the top table, the "Other Member's Read Status" columns will be updated too.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>memberships:created</b> this event arrives when a new user has been added to
                a space.  If it is our user the application calls the <em>rooms.getWithReadStatus()</em>
                function to get the details for the space and adds it to the list of "Caught Up"
                rooms. If the event is for another member, and the space is currently displayed
                on the top table, the "Other Member's Read Status" columns will be updated too.
              </li>
            <li>
                <b>memberships:deleted</b> this event arrives when a user has been removed from
                a space.  If it is our user the application removes the space from its cache.
                If it is another user in one of the spaces currently behind displayed, the "Other Member's Read Status" 
                columns will be udpated accordingly.
              </li>
            <li>
                <b>rooms:updated</b> this event may signal a change in the title for a space.  If so 
                the space cache and any releveant tables are updated.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p></p>
          <p>
            See the Webex <a href="https://developer.webex.com/docs/api/guides/webhooks/filtering-webhooks">Webhook Documentation</a> 
            for more information on the payloads of the membership, message and room events.   In general
            the SDK events closely match the payload of the webhooks, except in cases where the information
            in a traditional webhook envelope doesn't make sense, for example there is no <em>name, targetUrl</em>, or 
            <em>secret</em> field in the SDK event envelopes.  The SDK adds one event which is not yet supported in the webhooks.  A <em>memberships:seen</em> event 
            is generated when a Webex client sends a "read receipt".   The <em>membership:seen</em> event will include a 
            <em>lastSeenId</em> field with the id of the last message read by the user.  This can be compared with
            the <em>lastActivityId</em> field of the space to determine if the member is "caught up". 
          </p>
          <p>
            A few final points.   If the "Mark as Read" button is active, and pushed by the user, the application calls 
            <em>membership.updateLastSeen(message)</em> passing the relevant message data to it.   This generates a
            <em>membership:seen</em> event which is handled by our application as
            well as any Webex Teams clients that the user or other members of the space are using.
          </p>
          <p>
            As mentioned above the application maintains its own cache of space states which it updates when
            it receives events. This minimizes the number of calls it needs to make to the Webex Platform
            and keeps the application GUI response. The application is prepared to handle spaces that 
            are not in its cache by calling <em>rooms.getWithReadStatus()</em> "just in time".
