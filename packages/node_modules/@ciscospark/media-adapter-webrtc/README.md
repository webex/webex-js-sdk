> WebRTC Media Adapter for [ciscospark](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ciscospark)

This package provides abstracts the webrtc interface away from the phone plugin. This interface is still evolving, so at this time, we recommend against consuming this package directly. As the interface stabilizes, we'll provide a spec that allows implementing custom media adapters (thus offering the potential to support calling in nodejs).

## Install

```bash
npm install --save @ciscospark/media-adapter-webrtc
```

## Usage

This package should not be used directly but is consumed by [@ciscospark/plugin-phone](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ciscospark/plugin-phone).
