a ESLint configuration file must be consumed within the target package using the following configuration definition example:

```js
// ./.eslintrc.js

const config = {
  root: true, // Ignore all `.eslintrc.js` files in any parent directories.
  env: {
    node: true,
    // any additional env values needed for the package.
  },
  extends: [
    '@webex/eslint-config/core', // The base configuration.
    '@webex/eslint-config/jasmine', // Jasmine testing configuration.
    '@webex/eslint-config/typescript', // Typescript configuration.
  ],
  // Additional package configuration as needed.
};

module.exports = config;
```

Once the `./.eslintrc.js` file has been configured based on the information provided above, the following scripts can be amended to the package's `./package.json` file.

{
  "scripts": {
