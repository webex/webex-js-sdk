## Installation

Since this package is marked `private` as a part of its definition, it can only be consumed locally within this project.

This package is meant to be consumed as a **dev-dependency** and has the following required peer dependencies:

* `@webex/jasmine-config`
  * `@webex/cli-tools`
* `jasmine`
* `nyc`

This package is meant to be configured at runtime using the following **dev-dependency**:

* `@webex/cli-tools`

Installation, local to this project, can be performed by using the following commands:

```bash
# Project root installation.
yarn add --dev @webex/nyc-config @webex/jasmine-config @webex/cli-tools jasmine nyc

# Package installation.
yarn workspace @{scope}/{package} add --dev @webex/nyc-config @webex/jasmine-config @webex/cli-tools jasmine nyc
```

## Usage

This package is expected to be used with [NYC](https://github.com/istanbuljs/nyc), [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/), [@webex/jasmine-config](https://github.com/webex/webex-js-sdk/tree/master/packages/config/jasmine), and [@webex/cli-tools](https://github.com/webex/webex-js-sdk/tree/master/packages/tools/cli).

A `jasmine.config.js` configuration file must be consumed within the target package using the following the configuration example available within the [@webex/jasmine-config](https://github.com/webex/webex-js-sdk/tree/master/packages/config/jasmine) package.

Once the `jasmine.config.js` file has been configured per the [@webex/jasmine-config](https://github.com/webex/webex-js-sdk/tree/master/packages/config/jasmine) package, the following scripts can be amended to the package's `./package.json` file.

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "test:coverage": "nyc yarn test:integration --silent",
    "test:coverage:report": "nyc --reporter=lcov yarn test:integration --silent",
  }
}
```
