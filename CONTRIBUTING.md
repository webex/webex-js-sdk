## Reporting Issues

### Opening an Issue

The title of a Bug or Enhancement should clearly indicate what is broken or desired. Use the description to
explain possible solutions or add details and (especially for Enhancemnts) explain *how* or *why* the issue is
broken or desired. Please see [ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md](https://github.com/webex/webex-js-sdk/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.MD) that outlines what we are looking for.

**If providing snippets of code**, use [Markdown code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/#multiple-lines).

#### Grammar

While quibbling about grammar in issue titles may seem a bit pedantic, adhering to some simple rules can make it much
easier to understand a Bug or an Enhancement from the title alone. For example, is the title **"Browsers should support
blinking text"** a bug or a feature request?

- Enhancements: The title should be an imperative statement of how things should be. **"Add support for blinking text"**
- Bugs: The title should be a declarative statement of how things are. **"Text does not blink"**

#### Logs

Please provide sufficient logging around the issue which you are reporting as this will help with our investigation.
**DO NOT** include access tokens or other sensitive information. If you need to supply logs with sensitive information, supply them to developer support rather than posting them here; even when sending logs to developer support, **DO NOT** include access tokens.

### Build Dependencies

Before you can build the Cisco Webex JS SDK, you will need the following dependencies:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS)
  - We recommend using [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) (or [nvs](https://github.com/jasongin/nvs) on Windows _(not WSL)_) to easily switch between Node.js versions
  - Run `nvm use` to set your node version to the one this package expects
    - If the required node version is not installed, `nvm`/`nvs` will tell you the command needed to install it
  - Install the latest npm to enable security audits using `npm install -g npm@latest`
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [node-gyp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-gyp)
  - This is used during the dependency install process and is used to compile some native add-on modules
  - Install with `npm install -g node-gyp`
    - On Windows _(not WSL)_, follow [Option 1](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp#option-1) on node-gyp's repo, as this will automatically install python 2 and neccessary build dependencies
- [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/)
  - This is also used during the dependency install process
  - Attempting to update dependencies with a Python 3.x environment will fail

> #### NOTE FOR WINDOWS 10
>
> **We suggest using [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about) (WSL) for the best experience on Windows.** We've seen multiple tooling/package related errors when trying to build on a regular Windows environment. The build errors are a result of third-party node_modules that we do not maintain. These issues are not seen when using WSL.

You will need to create a file called `.env` that defines, at a minimum:

- `WEBEX_CLIENT_ID`
- `WEBEX_CLIENT_SECRET`
- `WEBEX_REDIRECT_URI`
- `WEBEX_SCOPE`

You can get these values by registering a new integration on [Cisco Webex for Developers](https://developer.webex.com/my-apps/new/integration).

### Building the SDK

Fork the [webex-js-sdk](https://github.com/webex/webex-js-sdk/) repository and `git clone` your fork:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/webex-js-sdk.git
```

Install tooling dependencies with:

```bash
npm install
```

Build the SDK:

```bash
npm run build
```

If at any point your builds or tests are failing with complaints of an invalid node version, the following commands will reset and rebuild everything:

```bash
nvm use; npm ci
```

*Build issues?* See [BUILD-ISSUES.md](./BUILD-ISSUES.md) for help.

### Running Tests

`npm test` is the entrypoint to our test runner, but its not practical to use without parameters; the full suite would take over two hours to run and cross talk would probably cause tests to break each other.

> Get the full test-runner docs via `npm test -- --help`.

A local development flow might look like

1. Edit source code in `MYPACKAGE`.
2. Use `npm run build` to build all packages .
3. Use `npm test -- --packages @webex/MYPACKAGE --node` to run the tests for just that package only in nodejs (Usually, we don't need to test both in node and the browser during development).
4. Repeats steps 1-3 until the tests pass.

`npm run build` is a bit tedious when making lots of changes, so instead, we can use `npm run distsrc` to point each package's `main` entry at the raw src and let `babel` compile on the fly.

1. At the start of development, run `npm run distsrc` once.
2. Edit source code in `MYPACKAGE`.
3. Use `npm test -- --packages @webex/MYPACKAGE --node` to run the tests for just that package only in nodejs.
4. Optionally, add environment variables to mimize logging and show any test specific logging, ie:
   - WEBEX_LOG_LEVEL - set this to "log" to minimize the default verbose output
   - DEBUG - if your test source includes the debug package set this to the appropriate string to enable debug output
   For exampe if you want to run only the plugin-messages test, and see the package specific logging, your command line would be:
   > `WEBEX_LOG_LEVEL=log DEBUG=messages npm test -- --packages @webex/plugin-messages --node`
5. Repeat steps 2-3 until the tests pass.
   > If you use VS Code, we've created a configuration to utilize the built-in debugger
   >    - Set breakpoints within the package you're working on
   >    - Select the `Test package` configuration
   >    - Enter the package you'd like to test (i.e. `MYPACKAGE`)
   >      - _The configuration already prepends `@webex/` for you unlike the cli command, so just `plugin-teams` is fine_
   >    - Add any _optional_ flags (i.e. `--node`)
   >      - _If you don't want to add any flags, just add a space (current workaround)_
6. Run `npm run srcdist` to restore the package.jsons to avoid committing those changes.

You can use the `--unit`, `--integration`, `--automation`, and `--documentation` switches to control what types of tests you run and `--node` and `--browser` to control which environments your tests run in.

The `--packages` flags will allow you to test multiple packages in one command instead of separate commands for each package `--packages @webex/plugin-meetings @webex/plugin-rooms @webex/plugin-teams`. Packages are still tested synchronously  to allow for proper output to the terminal.

`--browser --karma-debug` will run the browser tests with `{singleRun: false}`, thus allowing automatic rerunning everytime you save a file (though, karma does eventually get confused and you need to interrupt and restart the command).

You can use the `--browsers` _(not to be confused with the `--browser` tag)_ allows you to specify which browsers you want to run locally. This is restricted to what browsers are installed and available to you on your OS.
The default browsers that launch are _Headless_ version of Firefox and Chrome, so `--browsers Chrome Edge` will only launch a normal version of Chrome along with Edge. If you add `defaults` to the browsers flag, it will also launch `ChromeHeadless` and `FirefoxHeadless` along with other browsers you've specified. All browsers include flags to enable WebRTC features and permissions.

To run tests on [SauceLabs](https://saucelabs.com/) locally, you'll need to add a inline environment variable, `SAUCE=true`. Like mentioned above you can specify which browsers you'd like to test on with the `--browers` flag, but with SauceLabs service available to you, you can also specify which OS you'd like to test on. With the `--os` flag you have the option on testing on `Mac` and `Windows`. You can filter down the browsers that get launched by using the `--browsers` flag, so if you use `--os Windows --browsers Edge IE` it will launch only `Edge` and `IE`. Specifying just `--browsers` with `SAUCE=true` will launch that browsers in all available OSs, so `--browsers Firefox` will launch `Firefox` in `Mac` and `Windows`.
> **The default SauceLabs configuration _"`SAUCE=true npm run test`"_ is the latest versions of `Chrome` and `Firefox` on both `Mac` and `Windows`, along with `Edge` and `IE 11` on Windows, and `Safari` on Mac**
>
> `--os Mac` will launch `Chrome`, `Firefox`, and `Safari`
>
> `--os Windows` will launch `Chrome`, `Firefox`, `Edge`, and `IE 11`
>
> `--os Linux` WILL NEED `--browsers Firefox` as SauceLabs only supports `Firefox 45` for Linux. This is why it's also not included by default and requires two flags

> See more scripts at [SCRIPTS.md](SCRIPTS.md) to learn how to run tests and more.

#### Running Samples Locally

```bash
git clone git@github.com:webex/webex-js-sdk.git
cd webex-js-sdk
npm install
npm run build
npm run samples:serve
```

> NOTE: This installs all of the SDK's tooling dependencies, so you'll need `libgcrypt` and (possibly) `graphicsmagick`.
>
> - Mac
>   - You can install these with `brew install graphicsmagick libgcrypt`.
>
> - Ubuntu
>   - You can install these with `sudo apt-get install graphicsmagick libgcrypt-dev`
>
> - Windows
>   - You can install `graphicsmagick` using either [scoop](https://scoop.sh/) or [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/)
>     - scoop: `scoop install graphicsmagick`
>     - chocolotey: `choco install graphicsmagick`
>     - Also *globally* install `win-node-env` to resolve `NODE_ENV` windows related command issues

Head to [https://localhost:8000/](https://localhost:8000/) to use the samples

> NOTE: The samples use a self-signed certificate generated by [Webpack Dev Server](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/dev-server/#devserverhttps).
> Some browsers such as Google Chrome (or any other Chromium-based browser) may not allow access by default for security reasons.
> You may need to configure browser settings to allow these at your own risk by enabling the `chrome://flags/#allow-insecure-localhost` flag.

#### Samples Tests

The samples tests are run by <https://webdriver.io> which spins up two browser instances and has them communicate between each other.

These tests are run with `npm run samples:test`.
We have found that due to the h.264 codec downloading in Firefox, the best way to run these test is on SauceLabs.
You can run them on SauceLabs with `SAUCE=true npm run samples:test`.

To run a specific sample test instead of the full suite, append the `--spec` flag to the `samples:test` command and the path to the specific test

```sh
npm run samples:test -- --spec packages/node_modules/samples/browser-call-with-screenshare
```

If an error occurs when running the above command that appears to be related to a missing [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/) driver, the following command should install the needed external dependencies:

```sh
./node_modules/.bin/selenium-standalone install
```

##### Local Samples Tests

If you wish to run the samples tests locally, we suggest changing from the Chrome-to-Firefox multiremote setup to Chrome-to-Chrome.

You can do so by modifying the [wdio.conf.js](./wdio.conf.js) file.
Simply change the `browserFirefox`'s `desiredCapabilities` object to the same as `browserChrome` (the Chrome instance).
When you run, you should see two instances of Chrome open.

### Git Commit Guidelines

As part of the build process, commits are run through [conventional changelog](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/conventional-changelog)
to generate the changelog. Please adhere to the following guidelines when formatting your commit messages.

#### Commit Message Format

Each commit message consists of a **header**, a **body** and a **footer**. The header has a special format that includes a **type**, a **scope** and a **subject**:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>
<BLANK LINE>
<body>
<BLANK LINE>
<footer>
```

The **header** is mandatory and the scope of the header is optional.

Any line of the commit message cannot be longer 100 characters! This allows the message to be easier to read on GitHub as well as in various git tools.

#### Revert

If the commit reverts a previous commit, it should begin with `revert:`, followed by the header of the reverted commit. In the body it should say: `This reverts commit <hash>`., where the hash is the SHA of the commit being reverted.

#### Type

Must be one of the following:

- **feat**: A new feature
- **fix**: A bug fix
- **docs**: Documentation only changes
- **style**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
- **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- **perf**: A code change that improves performance
- **test**: Adding missing tests
- **chore**: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries such as documentation generation

#### Scope

The scope should indicate what is being changed. Generally, these should match package names. For example, `http-core`, `common`, `ciscospark`, etc. Other than package names, `tooling` tends to be the most common.

#### Subject

The subject contains succinct description of the change:

- use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"
- don't capitalize first letter
- no dot (.) at the end

#### Body

Just as in the **subject** the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes". The body should include the motivation for the change and contrast this with previous behavior.

#### Footer

The footer should contain any information about **Breaking changes** and is also the place to reference GitHub issues that this commit **closes**.

**Breaking Changes** should start with the word `BREAKING CHANGE:` with a space or two newlines. The rest of the commit message is then used for this.

#### Special Commit Messages

These are commit messages that will have an impact on how the build pipeline behaves. They are not to be used without prior approval.

All of these commit messages should include an explanation for why you're using them. You'll need to commit with `-n` or `--no-verify` to bypass the commit message linter.
> For example
> `git commit -m "docs(webex-core): [skip npm] - docs change" --no-verify`

##### `[skip npm]`

This will run through the all the Github Checks, but will skip any version bumping, tagging, and subsequent publishing to npm after a pull request is merged.

##### `[skip ci]`

This will skip the CircleCI pipeline entirely.

### Submitting a Pull Request

Prior to developing a new feature, be sure to search the [Pull Requests](https://github.com/webex/webex-js-sdk/pulls) for your idea to ensure you're not creating a duplicate change. Then, create a development branch in your forked repository for your idea and start coding!

When you're ready to submit your change, first check that new commits haven't been made in the upstream's `master` branch. If there are new commits, rebase your development branch to ensure a fast-forward merge when your Pull Request is approved:

```bash
# Fetch upstream master and update your local master branch
git fetch upstream
git checkout master
git merge upstream/master

# Rebase your development branch
git checkout feature
git rebase master
```

Finally, open a [new Pull Request](https://github.com/webex/webex-js-sdk/compare) with your changes. Be sure to mention the issues this request addresses in the body of the request. Once your request is opened, a developer will review, comment, and, when approved, merge your changes!

## Updating the Documentation

To compile the documentation locally, make sure you have [Bundler](http://bundler.io/) or
[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) installed then run the following:

### Set Up Environment (with Bundler)

```bash
cd docs
bundle install
```

### Compile and Serve Docs

```bash
cd docs
npm run build:docs
bundle exec jekyll serve --config=_config.yml,_config.local.yml
```
