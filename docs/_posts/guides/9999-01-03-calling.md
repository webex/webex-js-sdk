First, authenticate according to [Browsers]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url /guides/9999-01-02-browsers %}). From there, you'll need to register with our cloud and start listening for incoming calls.

```javascript
webex.phone.register();
```

> Previous versions of this guide indicated you were responsible for caching your own registration data. As of `ciscospark@0.7.0`, this is handled automatically for you.

To place a call, use `webex.phone.dial()`. Don't forget to connect the media streams to some video tags on your page.

> Previous versions of this guide instructued you to use `call.remoteMediaStreamUrl`. Changes to the webrtc spec mean that you should now reference `call.remoteMediaStream` and `call.localMediaStream` directly.

```javascript
var call = webex.phone.dial('alice@example.com');
call.on('connected', function() {
  document.getElementById('incoming-video').srcObject = call.remoteMediaStream;
});
call.on('localMediaStream:change', function() {
  document.getElementById('outgoing-video').srcObject = call.localMediaStream;
  // Mute the local video so you don't hear yourself speaking
  document.getElementById('outgoing-video').muted = true;
});
```

To handle an incoming call, listen for the `call:incoming` event

```javascript
webex.phone.on('call:incoming', function(call) {
  // Set up listeners to update the UI if the callee chooses to answer the call.
  call.on('connected', function() {
    document.getElementById('incoming-video').srcObject = call.remoteMediaStream;
  });
  call.on('localMediaStream:change', function() {
    document.getElementById('outgoing-video').srcObject = call.localMediaStream;
    // Mute the local video so you don't hear yourself speaking
    document.getElementById('outgoing-video').muted = true;
  });

  // Let the caller know that you've indicated to the callee that there's an incoming call
  call.acknowledge();

  // Answer the call
  call.answer();
});
```
