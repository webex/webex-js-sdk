# A Note on Browsers

Ciscospark is fully browser compatible but we don't distribute a browserified bundle at this time; you'll need to build the bundle yourself. We use [browserify](http://browserify.org/) internally and [webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) should work as well. We recommend using browserify or webpack for your project. If you prefer to load the `ciscospark` via a script tag, please follow the instructions in the [README](https://github.com/ciscospark/spark-js-sdk/blob/master/packages/ciscospark/README.md)

# OAuth

Since you don't want to compile your access token into your web app, for everyone to use, you'll need to ask users to enter a username and password (don't worry, we've taken care of the hard parts for you).

Before you can login with OAuth, you'll need to register a new application on the [developer portal](https://developer.ciscospark.com). While you won't be compiling *your* access token into your app, you will need to compile some of these values in.

When you build the sdk, make sure to set the environment variables:
- `CISCOSPARK_CLIENT_ID`
- `CISCOSPARK_CLIENT_SECRET`
- `CISCOSPARK_REDIRECT_URI`
- `CISCOSPARK_SCOPE`

In your application, kick off a login flow with `ciscospark.authorize()`. This will direct the browser to our login service.

Once the user logs in, we'll redirect them back to your app; the SDK will take care of grabbing the access token from the response and initializing with it.

Your credentials will be cached to `localStorage` automatically. Previous to `ciscospark@0.7.0`, you were responsible for caching your credentials. For more details on the storage layer, take a look at [Storage Layer]({% post_url 9999-03-01-storage-layer %})

The first network request you make will refresh the access token if it's expired. Alternatively, you can force a refresh.

```javascript
spark.refresh({force: true})
  .then(function() {
    // credentials have been refreshed
  });
```
