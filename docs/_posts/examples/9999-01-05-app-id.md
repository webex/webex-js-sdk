You can authorize spark using a jwt via

```javascript
getJwtFromYourApi({sub: "USER IDENTIFIER"})
  .then((jwt) => spark.authorize({jwt: jwt}))
  .then(() => {
    // spark is authorized
  });
```

If your API adds `exp` claims to your JWTs, you'll need to provide a means of fetching new JWTs when `ciscspark` needs to refresh.

If using the `ciscospark` singleton, this is as simple as

```javascript
const ciscospark = require(`ciscospark`);
ciscospark.credentials.requestJWT = function() {
  return getJwtFromYourApi();
}
```

And if using `ciscospark.init()`, it'll be

```javascript
const ciscospark = require(`ciscospark`);
ciscospark.init({
  requestJWT() {
    return getJwtFromYourApi();
  }
});
```

In each case `getJwtFromYourApi()` will need to send your local user identifiers to your backend to request a new JWT for the signed in user. From there, ciscospark will take over. `getJwtFromYourApi()` must return an object of the form `{jwt: String}`.
