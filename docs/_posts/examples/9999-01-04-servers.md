The [Getting Started](/example/getting-started) guide will get you pretty far in node land, but at some point, you'll probably want more users than just yourself.

> This guide and the corresponding code is still a work in progress. While every effort will be made to avoid breaking changes, expect some fluctuation around the initialization and authorization apis.

Before you can login users with OAuth, you'll need to register a new application on the [developer portal](https://developer.ciscospark.com). You'll need to set some of the values from that page as environment variables:
- `CISCOSPARK_CLIENT_ID`
- `CISCOSPARK_CLIENT_SECRET`
- `CISCOSPARK_REDIRECT_URI`
- `CISCOSPARK_SCOPE`

# Init

Use `ciscpspark.init()` to create new `CiscoSpark` instance.

```javascript
var ciscospark = require('ciscospark');
const spark2 = ciscospark.init();
```

Use the authorization url you got from the developer portal to authenticate your users and get back an auth code. Then, pass that auth code to spark

```javascript
spark2.authorize({code: <code>})
  .then(function() {
    return db.write('credentials', spark2.credentials.serialize());
  });
```

Clearly, saving the credentials is only useful if you load them, too.

```javascript
db.get('credentials')
  .then(function(credentials) {
    spark.credentials.set(credentials);
  });
```

Once you've loadded the cached credentials, the first network request you make will refresh the access token if it's expired. Alternatively, you can force a refresh.

```javacript
spark.refresh({force: true})
  .then(function() {
    // credentials have been refreshed
  });
```
