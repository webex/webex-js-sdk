description: "[beta] Calling with the Cisco Spark JavaScript SDK"
---

** The calling feature in the SDK is currently available in limited beta. If you'd like to join the beta program and share your feedback, please visit the [developer portal](https://developer.ciscospark.com/sdkaccess/). If you qualify, a Cisco employee will reach out to you. **

First, authenticate according to [Browsers]({% post_url 9999-01-02-browsers %}). From there, you'll need to register with our cloud and start listening for incoming calls.


```javascript
spark.phone.register();
```

> Previous versions of this guide indicated you were responsible for caching your own registration data. As of `ciscospark@0.7.0`, this is handled automatically for you.

To place a call, use `spark.phone.dial`. Don't forget to connect the media streams to some video tags on your page.

```javascript
const call = spark.phone.dial('alice@example.com');
call.on('connected', function() {
  document.getElementById('incoming-video').src = call.remoteMediaStreamUrl;
});
call.on('localMediaStream:change', function() {
  document.getElementById('outgoing-video').src = call.localMediaStreamUrl;
  // Mute the local video so you don't hear yourself speaking
  document.getElementById('outgoing-video').muted = true;
});
```

To handle an incoming call, listen for the `call:incoming` event

```javascript
spark.phone.on('call:incoming', function(call) {
  // Set up listeners to update the UI if the callee chooses to answer the call.
  call.on('connected', function() {
    document.getElementById('incoming-video').src = call.remoteMediaStreamUrl;
  });
  call.on('localMediaStream:change', function() {
    document.getElementById('outgoing-video').src = call.localMediaStreamUrl;
    // Mute the local video so you don't hear yourself speaking
    document.getElementById('outgoing-video').muted = true;
  });

  // Let the caller know that you've indicated to the callee that there's an incoming call
  call.acknowledge();

  // Answer the call
  call.answer();
});
```
