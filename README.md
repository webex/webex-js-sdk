# spark-js-sdk

> Monorepo containing the Cisco Spark JavaScript SDKs (both current and legacy).

[ciscospark](/packages/ciscospark) is a collection of node modules targeting our [external APIs](https://developers.ciscospark.com). Its core libraries take inspiration from our web client's Legacy SDK.

This README primarily discusses the tooling required to develop the Cisco Spark SDK.

## Install

Install tooling dependencies with

```bash
npm install
```

Install module dependencies with
```bash
npm run bootstrap
```
(This installs dependencies to packages/\*/node_modules)

## Usage

The following commands should be run from the SDK root directory. Tooling dependencies are typically defined only in the root node_modules directory to avoid duplicates. (eslint is installed in each package directory because many editors, or at least Atom, get confused by the monorepo layout and which eslint binary to use).

### Build

```bash
PACKAGE=PACKAGENAME npm run grunt:package -- build
```

### Run tests

```bash
PACKAGE=PACKAGENAME npm run grunt:package -- test
```

### Run just unit tests
Handy during early plugin development when you can write a bunch of unit tests.

```bash
UNIT_ONLY=true PACKAGE=PACKAGENAME npm run grunt:package -- test
```

### Run the tests, but only in nodejs
Usually faster, and can build on the fly, thus no need to rebuild everything between test runs

```bash
PACKAGE=PACKAGENAME npm run grunt:package -- express:test test:node
```

### Run tests in-browser in debug mode
Keeps the browser open so that you can reload set break points and reload the page

```bash
KARMA_DEBUG=true PACKAGE=PACKAGENAME npm run grunt:package -- express:test test:browser
```

### Serve the package
This is mostly useful for the the example app(s), but also comes in handy when debugging the credentials plugins automation tests.

```bash
PACKAGE=PACKAGENAME npm run grunt:package -- serve
```

### Running eslint on a single package
This is mostly useful for running the eslint on the packages

```bash
PACKAGE=PACKAGENAME npm run grunt:package -- eslint
```

For all packages
```bash
npm run grunt:concurrent -- eslint
```

### Run automation server and test manually
Run automation server and try to run test manually
```bash
PACKAGE=PACKAGENAME npm run grunt:package -- express:test test:automation --serve
```

### Run automation tests on localhost
Make sure chrome and firefox driver is installed.
To run test on a particular module

```bash
PACKAGE=PACKAGENAME npm run grunt:package -- test:automation --serve
```

### Run automation tests on sauce
To run automation on sauce

```bash
npm run sauce:start
npm run sauce:run -- PACKAGE=PACKAGENAME npm run grunt:package -- test:automation --serve
```

### Run unit tests in watch mode

OK, this one's a handful and requires a global package, but there were too many possible variants to hardcode it any where.

```bash
npm install -g nodemon
nodemon -w packages/PACKAGENAME/src -w packages/PACKAGENAME/test -x "UNIT_ONLY=true PACKAGE=PACKAGENAME npm run --silent grunt:package express:test test:node"
```
Aggressively log network requests
```bash
export ENABLE_VERBOSE_NETWORK_LOGGING=true
```

### Documentation
To compile the documentation locally, make sure you have [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) installed then run the following:

```bash
cd docs
jekyll serve --config=_config.yml,_config.local.yml
```
